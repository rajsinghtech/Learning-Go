## Learning Go and Network Automation
Welcome to my repository where I share my progress in learning Go and its application in network automation!

# About Me
I'm a computer engineer with a passion for automating network devices using the "Network to Code" concept. Up until now I have been leverating Python and XML/REST APIs to automate/monitor devices. As I dive deeper into the world of network automation, I've come to appreciate the concurrency advantages that Go offers over Python and hope to practice my skills as someone who wants to delve deeper into the industry.

# Why Go for Network Automation?
Go is a great language for network Automation due to its fast execution speed, concurrency support, and built-in networking libraries. Unlike Python, Go's concurrency model utilizes lightweight goroutines instead of threads, allowing for efficient parallelism and better resource utilization. Additionally, Go's standard library includes packages for building robust network applications, including the net and http packages.

# Network Automation with Go
In this repository, I'll be sharing my journey in learning Go and applying it to network Automation. I believe that Go's strengths in concurrency and networking make it the perfect language for writing secure, readable, and production-ready network code. As I progress, I'll be sharing examples of how to use Go to automate network devices, build RESTful APIs, and more.

# Conclusion
Thanks for checking out my repository! I hope that my progress in learning Go and network Automation with Go can inspire others to explore this powerful language and its potential for network automation.
